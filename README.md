# Buck Converter State-Space Model and Frequency Response Analysis

## Overview

The `BuckR2P2_Latin.m` script models a buck converter using state-space representation and computes its transfer function. It generates plots of the open-loop frequency response and loop gain, as presented in the associated article. Additionally, it outputs parameter values corresponding to the tables in the article.

## Files

- `BuckR2P2_Latin.m`: MATLAB script containing the state-space model, transfer function computation, frequency response analysis, and parameter value outputs.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2017b or later.

## Usage

1. **Running the Script**:
   - Open `BuckR2P2_Latin.m` in MATLAB.
   - Execute the script by clicking the "Run" button or by typing `run('BuckR2P2_Latin.m')` in the Command Window.

2. **Outputs**:
   - **Plots**:
     - *Open-Loop Frequency Response*: Bode plot illustrating the system's open-loop behavior.
     - *Loop Gain*: Plot depicting the gain of the feedback loop.
   - **Parameter Values**:
     - Displays calculated parameter values corresponding to the tables in the article.

## Notes

- Ensure all necessary MATLAB toolboxes are installed for optimal script performance.
- For detailed explanations of the models and analyses, refer to the associated article.
